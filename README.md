Welcome to the Earth Engine DEM Code Repository! This repository contains a collection of code snippets and projects specifically related to Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in Earth Engine. Here, you will find code examples and resources to help you analyze, visualize, and manipulate DEM data using Earth Engine.

**Introduction**
Digital Elevation Models provide valuable information about the Earth's surface topography. With Earth Engine, you can access and process high-resolution DEM datasets to derive insights and perform various geospatial analyses. Whether you're interested in terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, or slope calculations, Earth Engine's capabilities and computational power can help you achieve your goals.

**Repository Structure**
This repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of DEM analysis. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

01-data-preparation: This directory contains code snippets and scripts related to data ingestion, preprocessing, and preparation of DEM datasets. It includes tasks such as data fusion, resampling, and data format conversions.

02-visualization: Here, you'll find code examples for visualizing DEMs and derived products. This includes techniques for generating hillshades, contour plots, slope maps, and 3D visualizations.

03-analysis: In this directory, you'll discover code snippets for conducting various analyses on DEM data. It covers tasks like terrain classification, aspect calculation, watershed delineation, and viewshed analysis.

04-modelling: If you're interested in modeling terrain-related phenomena, this directory is for you. It includes code examples for hydrological modeling, flood risk assessment, solar radiation modeling, and other related applications.

05-change-detection: Here, you'll find code snippets for detecting changes in the Earth's surface using DEM differencing techniques. It covers tasks like measuring elevation changes, identifying landforms, and monitoring erosion or deposition.

06-applications: This directory showcases complete projects and applications built using DEM data and Earth Engine. It includes examples such as landslide susceptibility mapping, landform analysis, and glacier monitoring.

Feel free to explore each directory, find the code that interests you, and adapt it to your specific needs. Each directory contains its own README file with more detailed information about the code and examples provided.
